# 🚭 StopSmoke App

A pet project based on **MVP-C architecture**, using **REST API**, custom backend built with **Vapor**, and layout built with **SnapKit**.

## 💡 Idea

The goal of the app is to help users **quit smoking** by collecting data, tracking statistics, and providing visual insights into their progress.

## 💬 Why This Project?

I started this project as a personal challenge to improve my development skills while building something that could help others. It's meant to showcase my understanding of modern iOS development principles, such as architecture (MVP-C), networking, secure data management and building own backend using VAPOR. 

Though the app is still in progress, I aim to make it a complete, functional product. This is an open-ended project where I can continuously refine my skills.

## ✅ Features Implemented

- 🎯 **Coordinator** — Modular navigation with clear responsibility separation.
- 🌐 **Network Manager** — Handles all REST API interactions with the Vapor backend.
- 🔐 **Keychain Manager** — Secure token storage using iOS Keychain.
- 🔑 **Authorization** — Sign up, login, and token handling flow.
